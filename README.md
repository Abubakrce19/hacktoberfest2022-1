## :wrench: Repositories & Contribution Ideas

Under [Devtron-labs](https://github.com/devtron-labs) we have multiple repositories that hold some part of the code that goes into making Devtron what it is. You can learn about those in the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/devtron-labs/devtron/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) in Devtron's main repository. 

**Note: Non-Code PR Submissions need to have meaningful changes that span over 20 lines. PRs would not be accepted if the changes seem too insignificant or unnecessary.**

### :hammer: Some areas that need contributions

* [Community Chart Contributions](https://github.com/devtron-labs/devtron/tree/main/contrib-chart) - Add custom helm charts that can be used in Devtron

* [Sample Docker Templates](https://github.com/devtron-labs/devtron/tree/main/sample-docker-templates) - Add Dockerfile templates for various technologies. Eg, Django templates, Gradle Templates, etc

* [Documentation](https://docs.devtron.ai/) - See a feature that isn't mentioned in the documentation? Open a PR and add it to the documentation.

## :rotating_light:  Events

<summary>Hunt-a-Bug - October 9th to October 31st</summary> 
<br>
Nobody likes bugs. Especially if those bugs prevent you from doing what the product is intended for. We had a major release recently and haven't had much opportunity to test it well.

We would appreciate your help in testing Devtron to make sure it works properly.

### :question: How do I contribute?

It's simple. Use the [documentation](https://docs.devtron.ai/) to install and use Devtron. You can install it on various cloud providers to make sure that it installs without any problems.

You can also test whether it works on [MicroK8S](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Somq_ZWzO3E) on a VM instance. If you find any bugs, please raise an issue in the [Devtron Repository](https://github.com/devtron-labs/devtron).

Not sure if what you are facing is a bug? Hop over in our [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/QybkzXkPJR) and we can figure out if it's big or not :smile:

If you think you know what's wrong, feel free to discuss it with the maintainers and open a PR to fix the bugs :wrench:
