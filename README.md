You can learn about those in the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/devtron-labs/devtron/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) in Devtron's main repository. 

**Note: Non-Code PR Submissions need to have meaningful changes that span over 20 lines. PRs would not be accepted if the changes seem too insignificant or unnecessary.**
